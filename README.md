A little script I threw together to automate logging into gacha games. Uses AutoHotKey macroses and NoxPlayer.

If you would ever want to use this script, you will need to edit config.json according to where your apps are, after you will need to run the convertAHK script (to convert all the ahk scripts in this project to executables).

Accepts "install" as an argument, will install all the .apk files in the "APKs" folder of the project.
